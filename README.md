# Advent of Code Attempts
Each file in this repo is an Elixir Livebook that can be run to (attempt) to solve each day's 
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2025/) problem.

The easiest way to run them is to pull this repo, start 
[Livebook](https://livebook.dev/) locally, and then open the day you're interested in.

Have fun!
